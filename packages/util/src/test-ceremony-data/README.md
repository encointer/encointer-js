# Test-data
This directory contains test-data generated by the encointer rust client with the command:

```bash
./target/release/encointer-client-notee print-ceremony-stats --cid <test-cid>
```

The output of that command can be copied to this directory in a new file. All that is needed is to prepend 
`export default` to the file, and adding the new test to `index.ts`. The new test-case will automatically be executed
in the assignment tests.
